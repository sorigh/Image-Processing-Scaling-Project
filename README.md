# Image-Processing-Scaling-Project

A C++ project that implements grayscale image resizing using four interpolation methods:
- Nearest Neighbor 
- Bilinear 
- Bicubic 
- Lanczos

All methods are implemented manually using OpenCV for image loading and saving.
Each method is compared to the built in OpenCV function using PSNR, SSIM and RMSE as references.
## To-Do
- Add support for color images
- Add input validation and error messages
