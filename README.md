# Image-Processing-Scaling-Project

A C++ project that implements grayscale image resizing using four interpolation methods:
- Nearest Neighbor 
- Bilinear 
- Bicubic 
- Lanczos

All methods are implemented manually using OpenCV for image loading and saving.
Each method is compared to the built in OpenCV function using PSNR, SSIM and RMSE as references.

Added support for color images and improved execution time.
